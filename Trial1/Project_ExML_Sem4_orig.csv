Enough; no more.'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.","If melody be the sustenance of affection, strike up the orchestra. Provide me with an abundance of it, until, overwhelmed, desire fades away, withers, and succumbs. Let the harmonies resonate once more! They possessed a waning cadence.

"Jane Eyre","The prospect of a promenade was utterly impossible on that particular day.
